data("presidents")
```

### The Goal

This portfolio piece began after coming across the data set, "presidents". I was immedietly drawn into the name of the data set wanted to know more. The data set includes quaterly approval ratings from the years 1945 until 1974. For each year, there are four values associated with a quarterly approval rating, culiminating in 120 total values. 

The goal of this portfolio piece is to create a data visualization that depcits the change in presidential approval ratings from 1945 to 1974. This visualization will provide a foundation for this portfolio as it begins with curiosity and historical trends in American politics. 

```{r}
print(presidents)
```


```{r plot, message=TRUE}
plot(presidents, las = 1, ylab = "Approval rating (%)",
     main = "Presidential Approval Ratings from 1945 to 1975")
```
