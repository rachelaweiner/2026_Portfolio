> The projects should be numbered consecutively (i.e., in the order in which you began them), and should include for each project a description of the goal, the product (computer program, hand graph, computer graph, etc.), the data, and some interpretation. Reports must be reproducible and of high quality in terms of writing, grammar, presentation, etc.

The goal of this portfolio piece is to understand whether age is a significant factor that contributes to public opinion of government action. I will create a visualization to graphs age of participants with how they feel the government handles poverty to visualize any apparent trends. Lastly, I will do the same for gender to see whether this variable contributes to any identity differences in pubic opinion.
